Steps to run the script:

1. Make a directory named 'all_subs' in the same directory as the script.
2. Place the zip file that you submitted on moodle in the `all_subs` folder. Make sure to name it
   as `rollnumber.zip` (ex: `2020111012.zip`)
3. Now, run the python script using the command `python3 runner.py`
4. It should create a `logs` folder with the log file of your submission. It will contain any errors that the script
   encountered while running your code. It will also log the tests that passed/failed
5. The resulting score of the submission is put in `results.csv`
